                        <h3>Nice Place</h3>
                        <p>Had an excellent time in Hotel Transylvania. The staff is efficient, warm and courteous. The property is very well maintained. The food is excellent and the variety offered was a huge plus our kids liked the place very much. The pool is beautifully maintained. It's was a perfect weekend getaway for our family brunch or dinner.</p>
